**What executes WeensyOS code**

- Three triggers:
  - A system call invoked by a user-mode process
  - An interrupt from external hardware (timer, keyboard, network card, etc)
  - An exception raised by user or kernel mode code
    - Ex: dereferencing a null pointer, dividing by zero
- System calls and exceptions are synchronous: they're triggered immediately by something an instruction just did
- Interrupts are asynchronous: they can occur at any moment between the execution of two instructions
- When an exception or interrupt is encountered:
  - The `IF` flag in `%rflags` is disabled, preventing maskable interrupts from happening
  - If CPU isn't already privileged, changes cpu mode to privileged and points `%rsp` to the kernel stack
  - Pushes exception / interrupt state onto the stack
  - Non maskable interrupts are urgent ones that cannot be disabled via the `IF` flag
    - The `Machine Check` interrupt
    - The OS has misconfigured the CPU so badly that we cannot proceed further
    - Watchdog timer that checks OS health

**Exceptions and interrupts: setup**

- At boot time, the kernel configures the CPU with the system call entry point
- At boot time, the kernel also configures the CPU with the exception entry points and the interrupt entry points

**Why use a kernel stack?**

- The kernel uses its own stack to respond to system calls, exceptions, and interrupts
- Why it should be separate:
  - The kernel should assume the user-level code mismanages registers or memory
  - Using page tables and MMU, kernel memory cannot be accessed by user level code
  - The kernel places its stack, heap, code, and other data in memory that only privileged code can touch
  - The kernel also validates any arguments passed from user code via system calls
- Kernels must isolate processes from eachother, from the kernel, and from hardware devices
  - Because the kernel must assume user level code is malicious
  - User level code must uses syscalls for process management

**Virtual memory**

- Don't let code access physical memory directly
  - CPU instructions manipulate virtual memory addresses in [0, 2^v - 1]
  - The kernel defines the mapping between virtual and physical memory addresses in [0, (2^p) - 1]
  - The kernel installs a virtual to physical address mapping (the page table) when context switching to a particular process
  - A CPU's MMU hardware enforces the kernel-established mapping
  - Physical memory addresses are what the CPU actually sends to DRAM hardware
