**Memory recap**

- A program's address space has four segments:
  1. Code
  2. Data
  3. Stack
  - Stack grows down
  4. Heap
  - Heap grows up
- Lifetime of a C++ object depends on which segment it lives in:
  - Code and static data live from process initialization to termination
  - Compiler inserts stack instructions to allocate and deallocate space on the stack; data lives as long as it's in scope
  - The heap requires manual allocation and deallocation

**Heap allocation and deallocation**

- OS keeps track of sizes and locations of code, static data, stack, and heap
- The C++ _runtime_ tracks the locations of free space in the heap
- During a call to `new <type>`
  - If the heap has `sizeof(<type>)` contiguous free bytes, the C++ runtime allocates those bytes
  - Otherwise, the C++ runtime invokes a syscall like `sbrk()` to ask the OS to increase the size of the heap
    - _shift breakpoint_
    - If that works, the break pointer is increased to accomodate the new size
    - Space is allocated for the new value, and a pointer is returned
  - Think of `new` as a normal function written and provided by the runtime developers
- During a call to `delete <var_name>`
  - Deallocate the heap bytes (update the internal metadata to indicate those bytes are no longer in use)
    - Runtime may also use a syscall to shring the heap if there are free bytes at the end of the heap. Many languages don't do that, though.
- What happens if the program tries to print the memory at the freed value?
  - This results in undefined behavior
  - When memory is freed, all pointers pointing into the freed memory space become invalid, and dereferencing them produces undefined behavior
  - Undefined behavior is not guaranteed to deterministically perform the same behavior each time the program is run
    - Not guaranteed to crash the program. Just causes ??? behavior.

**What is a runtime**

- Code that is provided by the language implementation
  - ex: clang provides the compiler, other libraries, etc
- Any program not written in assembly has a runtime
  - Some runtimes are more coddling than others
  - Ex. Garbage collection
- In the C++ runtime:
  - `new` and `delete` functions manage heap memory (PSET 1 is runtime code)
  - There are functions that set variables to default values
  - The code that implements I/O

**C++: Primitive v. Compound types**

- A type describes:
  1. A set of possible values
  2. A set of valid operations on those values
- A primitive type is not composed of other types
- A compound type can aggregate one or more primitive types

**C++ object layout**

- The C++ standard restricts the runtime positions objects in memory
  - Two objects cannot overlap in memory. Memory is exclusively owned.
  - For an array holding elements of type T:
    - Each value must be arranged sequentially and without gaps
    - Given an array with starting address _a_, the _i-th_ element lives at memory location _a + (i \* sizeof(T))_
    - The total amount of memory consumed by the array is _N \* sizeof(T)_
- Struct fields are laid out sequentially but not adjacently!

**C++ unions**

- Like a struct, a union aggregates primitive types
- Unlike a struct, a union only has enough space to store the largest of its contained types

  - At any given point, only one of the possible values in a union is valid
  - Unions are often associated with a tag to determine which union field is valid

  ```c++
  int main() {
      struct {
        union {
            char c;
            double d;
          } u;
          bool is_char; // The tag
      }
      s.u.c = '3';
      s.is_char = true;
      printf("%zu\t", sizeof(s.u)); // 8 because a double is 8 bytes and the union is the size of its largest member
      printf("%zu\n", sizeof(s.is_char)); // 1 byte because a byte is the minimum memory size and a boolean doesn't need more
      printf("%zu\n", sizeof(s)); // 16 (not 9!) because of alignment.
  }
  ```

  **Alignment**

  - Modern CPUs fetch data from RAM in units of cache lines
  - If a primitive value spanned two separate but adjacent cache lines, then reading or writing that value would require two RAM accesses
  - So, the C++ standard imposes alignment restrictions
  - When the compiler picks locations in memory, we don't want them to span cache lines

**C++ memory alignment**

- A type T has an alignment requirement of A if any value of type T must start at a memory address that is evenly divisible by A
  - If something has an alignment of 8 bytes, its starting address must be evenly divisble by 8
- All valid alignments must be a power of 2
  - Any particular alignment will be aligned with all smaller alignments
- Each primitive type T has an alignment of `alignof(T)`
- Each element of a compound object must satisfy alignment:
  - Array: `alignof(T[N]) == alignof(T)`
  - Struct: `alignof(struct{ T_0, T_1, T_N }) == max(alignof(T_i))`
    - The struct has an alignment requirement matching the greatest alignment among its members
    - Ensures the first member is aligned
      - Additional members may need padding to be properly aligned

**Padding example**

```c++
struct {
    char a; // alignof(char) = 1
    int b; // alignof(int) = 4
    short c; // alignof(short) = 2
    char d; // alignof(char) = 1
}
```

- Any starting location for s will satisfy the alignment properties for `s.a` and `s.d`
- However, arbitrary starting locations for `s` are not guaranteed to ensure alignment for `s.b` and `s.c`
- Size of the struct must be a multiple of the alignment
- See lecture notes for breakdown of allocation for alignment. It's really cool.

**Collection representation**

1. First member rule: the address of the first member of a collection must equal the address of the collection
2. Array rule: Arrays are laid out sequentially.
3. Struct rule: The second and subsequent members of a struct are laid out in order with no overlap subject to alignment constraint.
4. Union rule: All members of a union share the address of the union.
