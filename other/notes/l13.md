**Linux: C++ File IO**

- Linux disallows a process from directly interacting with persistent storage devices
- Instead, a process must use system calls to interact with files
- Linux maintains a buffer cache in kernel memory
  - The cache stores recently-accessed file blocks
  - Linux does not synchronously flush dirty blocks to disk unless the application requests it
- stdio provides higher-level interfaces for file IO
  - Behind the scenes, this invokes syscalls
  - The library also implements is own caching layer for file data
- With both `fputc` and `write`, the async nature of buffer flushing can cause data loss from dirty blocks
  - Both Linux and `stdio` allow programs to explicitly flush buffered data
    - Flushing `stdio` cache triggers a `write()` to the kernel's buffer cache
  - Flushing the buffer cache forcibly sends blocks to the storage device
- The OS also allows a process to `open()` a file for synchronous `write()` (as opposed to default async with buffering)
- But synchronous IO is also slower
  - Need to think carefully about whether performance or crash tolerance is more important
  - Ex: maybe database transactions for a financial service must be persistent before clients are notified of transaction completion

**Common optimizations for systems**

- Read prefetching:
  - Proactively fetch data into the cache before it might be requested by the program.
    - Hides the cost of fetching from slow underlying storage.
    - If the cache isn't actually needed later, this generates unnecessary IO traffic, slowing down other requests
    - Caches have finite size, so that might evict something useful
  - Classic prefetching optimization is to sequentially read a region of the underlying storage device
    - Also fetches objects within a lookahead window
  - Linux uses prefetching in its buffer cache. Kernel tries to detect file access patterns that suggest sequential prefetching would be useful.
  - The `posix_fadvise()` system call allows a process to provide the kernel with prefetching/caching hints
- Write coalescing:
  - A particular cache block is often updated several times in short succession
  - In these scenarios, the cache decreases write traffic to the underlying storage device by not immediately synching a dirty block to the underlying storage
  - However, delaying the write back of dirty data will increase the amount of data lost aftre a crash or power outage

**stdio cache design**

- In `stdio`, a FILE is mostly a wrapper for struct `_IO_FILE`, which contains syscall responses, flags, and a buffer
  - When a program is reading frm a file, `stdio` fetches 4 kb of data surrounding the target location of the read along a 4-kb aligned boundary

**Cache coherency**

- A cache usually tries to be transparent
  - For a read, the cache should return what a direct read from storage would return
  - For a write sent to the cache, the newlt written block should be immediately visible via subsequent reads of a block
- A fully transparent cache is called coherent
  - The buffer cache is coherent with respect to the persistent storage device
    - If a buffer cache block is clean, it represents the associated disk contents
    - If a buffer cache block is dirty, it would be returned by a cache read for that block and will eventually be written to the storage devices
- The `stdio` cache is not coherent!
- Non coherent caches exist because they're easier to design and implement than coherent caches
  - They're also faster because there's no need to track and invalidate stale data
  - For programs dependent on coherency, life becomes much more difficult with non-coherent caches
  - Via `setvbuf`, stdio allows a process to disable stdio-level caching
  - Applications can also flush + empty the current stdio-level cache to the kernel using `fflush(FILE* fl)`

**Linux: C++ File IO**

- Reading / writing at a larger granularity allows the same amount of data to be handled with fewer system calls
  - Reduces how many times you must pay the context-switch overhead between user code and kernel code
  - Avoids unnecessary per-request latencies associated with storage hardware
- The `setvbuf` stdio call allows a process to supply a larger buffer for stdio to use for IO involving a particular file
- A program which directly invokes system calls can also directly provide larger buffers
- Writing larger chunks of data makes IO much faster
- The OS talks to the storage device at the granularity of the device's block size
  - The device is _only_ capable of exchanging data at the granularity of a well-aligned block
  - For modern SSDs and hard disks, the block size is typically 512 B or 4 KB
  - Processes typically maximize IO efficiency by issuing an IO that is:
    - A multiple of the block size of the underlying device
