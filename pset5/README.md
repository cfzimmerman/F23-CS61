CS 61 Problem Set 5
===================

**Fill out both this file and `AUTHORS.md` before submitting.** We grade
anonymously, so put all personally identifying information, including
collaborators, in `AUTHORS.md`.

Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
Tbh some of the code here got pretty ugly. 
Just imagine how much better it would be if C++ had 
tagged enums and pattern matching (**cough cough was Rust).

Also, sorry about the autoformatting. If the course could provide a `clang-format`
file or something similar, I'd really appreciate it. `sh61.cc` is totally 
_remodeled_ anyway, but there will be some pointless diffs on `sh61.hh` becuase 
of that. That said, I definitely recommmend beginning by reading the 
doc comment above the `command` class in `sh61.hh`, as that explains 
the shape of the command tree I used.


Extra credit attempted (if any)
-------------------------------
None yet, but I'd like to later this week if I have time.
