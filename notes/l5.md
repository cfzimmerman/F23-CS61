**Internalize**

- Bugs are my fault

**Debugging mindset**

- A bug is a signal
  - My expectation of reality does not match what should be happening
- When a bug occurs, think explicitly and concretely about my extectations
  - Determine how they differ from the program's response
  - Determine whether the code or my expectations must be changed

**Assertions**

- Use for sanity checks on logical (im)possibilities
- If a program encounters a serious logic error, fail stop is desirable
- Avoid assertions for routine failures (ex. no free space in the heap)
- Always check the return value of a system call, but we shouldn't use assertions for that

**Good programming habits**

- Read your code, simulate behavior, and determine if that's actually what it's supposed to do
  - Is my code written in such a way that actually communicates what I want to do?
- Incrementally write a bit of code, desk check the code, compile the program, then test the program

**Reproducible test cases**

- Have a way to deterministically re-create bugs
- The best reproducible test case is a minimal one that will trigger the bug
- When trying to fix a bug, try to generate:
  1. A minimal, reproducible test case
  2. An idea of what should happen and what is happening

**Nondeterministic bugs**

- Sometimes a program may do different things given a fixed set of inputs
  - Presence of randomness
  - A program may trigger undefined behavior
- Trying to debug a problem may cause it to disappear
  - Ex: adding a `printf` may change the structure of the stack causing a bug to go away
  - Heisenbugs
- Finding the source of nondeterminism is often the first step to debugging this kind of situation

**Address sanitization**

- Goal: Detect out of bounds memory access and uses of deallocated memory
- Strategy for the heap:
  - Divide the heap int 8-byte aligned chunks of 8 bytes each
  - For each chunk, maintain a byte of _shadow memory_ (metadata) tracking how many of a chunk's bytes are valid
  - 0 means all 8 bytes are valid
  - Some k between 1 and 7, the first k bytes are valid
  - Anything else means the memory shouldn't be accessed
  - Update shadow memory during new and delete
  - For each instruction that tries to access memory, have the compiler insert new instructions to check shadow memory to see if the access is valid
- Address sanitizers are not guaranteed to catch all memory errors
- Redzones:
  - The heap allocator overallocates, placing an object in the middle of a heap region bigger than the object
    - Prevents overreads and underreads from triggering errors because of adjacent allocations
  - Shadow memory for redzones is marked as invlid
    - Approach guarantees that invlid memory access "near" an object is detected
- There's a meaningful trade-off for sanitization and performance, so sanitization is typically only used during testing
