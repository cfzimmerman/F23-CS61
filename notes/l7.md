**Overview of a CPU operation**

- The CPU iteratively
  - Fetch an instruction from RAM
  - Decode that instruction (to know what operation to perform)
    - By default, that's the sequentially adjacent instruction instr\_{i + 1}
    - Unless instr_i is a control flow instruction, in which case the program is redirected
  - Perform the desired operation
- Three basic types of instructions:
  - Arithmetic: perform math in registers or memory
  - Data movement: copy values between registers and memory
  - Control flow: implements if-else statements, for loops, function calls, etc.
    - Branching instructions:
      - Unconditional: `jmp`, `ret`
      - Conditional: `jle`

**Register slices**

- A b-bit processor has registers that are b bits wide
  - x86 started with 16 bits. Now most are 64 bits.
- However, on a modern x86-64 processor, some general purpose registers can be accessed via slices that expose only a contiguous subset of the bits in the register
  - `%rax`: the entire register (0 - 63)
  - `%eax`: the lowest 32 bits (0 - 31)
  - `%ax`: the lowest 16 bits (0 - 15)
  - `%ah`: bits (8 - 15)
- Suffixes change which slices are being manipulated
  - `b`: 8 bit "byte"
  - `w`: 16 bit "words"
  - `l`: 32 bit "long words"
  - `q`: 64 bit "quad words"

**Register slices**

- Compilers use register slices to naturally map source code numeric types to the appropriately sized registers
  - Supporting 16 bit or 32 bit instructions also allows an x86-64 CPU to provide backwards compatibility with old software compiled for 16 or 32 bit CPUs

**General purpose registers on x86-64**

- Check course notes for general purpose registers
- And special purpose registers

**Data operands and address modes**

- `$i`: an immediate value (constant)
- `%r`: a register value
- `(%r)`: an indirect reference, dereferences the pointer in `%r`
- `o(%r)`: base + offset indirect reference, accesses the memory value at location %r + o
- `g(%rip)`: a global symbol that lives at offset g from the current `%rip`, used to find some global constant value

**My questions**

- Will `%rbp` and `%rsp` always point to the same stack frame (even if not the same point in memory)

**Arithmetic instructions**

- The general format is `op src, dst` which means `dst = dst op src`

**More complicated memory references**

- x86 supports an `offset(base, index, scale)` mode
  - The referenced value is at `offset + base + (index * scale)`
  - Offset must be a constant
  - Scale must be 1, 2, 4, or 8
  - The default offset, base, ad index are 0, whereas the default scale is 1
- This is helpful for array accesses

**Bitwise operations**

- Left shifting and right shifting move the gits to the left or right
  - `a << i`: move the bits in a to the left by i positions, filling vacated bits on the right with 0s
  - Left shifting is equivalent to setting `a = a * 2^i`
  - Right shifting:
    - `a >> i`: move the bits in a to the right by i position, filling the vacated bits with:
    - 0 if a is unsigned
    - Right shifting is equivalent to setting a = a / 2^i
- Bitwise not, and or exclusive or
  - Read the docs :)
