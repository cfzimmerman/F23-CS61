**Recap**

- A CPU can only work on one task at a time.
- MMU is a memory management unit configured by the cpu. When a user-level process is running, that process can only access its assigned region of memory.
- The CPU has a timer that interrupts a user-level process if it takes too long to return control back to the kernel.
  - A syscall willingly relinquishes control back to the CPU to ask it to compute something
- The CPU time slices between programs

**Data types in C++**

- A type describes two things: (1) a set of possible values and (2) a set of allowable operations on those values
- A _primitive type_ is not composed of other types
  - Integers support arithmetic, comparison, and bitwise operators
  - Floating point numbers (including INFINITY, NAN) support arithmetic and comparison operators
  - Booleans and comparison operators
  - Pointers support arithmetic operators
    - Pointer types are a pointer to a specific data type. There is no standard pointer type in C++.
    - Simple pointer example:
      ```c++
      int id = 999;
      int* ptr = &id;
      ```

**Values in C++**

- CPU instructions manipulate bits that are stored in registers and memory
  - 8 bits is a byte
  - An "x-bit" CPU has registers that are "x" bits in size
- A bit pattern ca be represented in various ways:
  - 16-bit pattern: `01100111'11000011`
  - Hex: `67c3`
  - Decimal: `26563`
- C++ abstract machine defines the memory model, valid data types, and control flow operations
- The compiler translates abstract machine manipulations into CPU instructions
- Different types have different types for interpreting the bits in a value
  - So the same set of bits can be interpreted to have different meanings depending on the type
  - A VALUE CANNOT BE DETERMINED BY JUST LOOKING AT ITS BIT REPRESENTATION
  - Interesting, a CPU has separate ALUs for floating point and integer representations
  - Ex, all these take up the same bit representation:
  ```c++
  int a1 = 1;
  unsigned char a2[] = {1, 0, 0, 0};
  unsigned short a3[] = {1, 0};
  unsigned a4 = 1;
  float a5 = 1.4013e-45;
  ```

**sizeof() operator in C++**

- C++ `sizeof(x)` allows a program to retrieve the size in bytes of the value belonging to x
  - Ex. On Linux x86-64 sizeof(char) is 1

**Objects in C++**

- An object is a vlue stored in one or more adjacent memory locations
  - Values like 42 or false are platonic: they exist and can never change
  - However an object's state may transform over time
- A computer uses RAM hardware to store objects

**Lifecycle of a process**

1. Design the program
2. Translate design to source code (C++)
3. Compile the program (CGG)
4. Binary executable arrives on the user's storage device
5. Via shell or GUI, user requests launching a new instance of the executable
6. Shell or GUI uses system calls to...
   - Create a new process
   - Read code and static data from the executable; place that into the memory region that belongs to that process
   - Have the new process begin running the loaded code

- Address space:

  - Stack
  - Heap
  - Static data
  - Code

- Stack frames store the values in local memory
  - Incrementing a variable destroys the previous stack frame and pushes a new frame onto the stack
  - When a function goes out of scope, that stack frame is released
  - Stores values known at compile time
- The heap stores dynamically allocated memory
  - A programmer must explicitly allocate and deallocate heap memory
  ```c++
  int* ptr = new int;
  do_stuff(ptr);
  delete ptr;
  ```
- The compiler and program loader automatically allocates memory space for static data
