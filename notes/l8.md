**Function lifecycle**

- Step 1: Caller preparation
  - Arrange arguments
  - If the caller has values in caller-saved registers, the caller saves their values on the stack so that the calling function can use those registers without overwriting the caller's values (calling convention)
  - The caller tells the callee where to return to (which instruction to point to upon returning)
  - Caller invokes the callee
- Step 2: Callee preparation
  - Callee creates a new stack frame (function prologue)
  - If the callee wants to manipulate variables in callee-saved registers, the callee must save those registers in the stack
- Step 3: Callee execution
- Step 4: Callee termination
  - Callee sets up the return value (calling convention)
  - Callee deallocates the stack frame (function epilogue)
  - Callee returns to the appropriate instruction in the caller, the `ret` instruction

**X86-64 System V Calling Convention**

- Simplest case: callee arguments and retval are integers or pointer
  - Caller stores the first six arguments in `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx`, `%rcx`, `%r8`, and `%r9`
  - Remaining arguments are passed via the stack
  - Callee places the return value in `%rax`

**Functions: Red Zones**

- A leaf function is a function that does not invoke other functions
- For a leaf function, the compiler may emit code that
  - Does not decrement `%rsp` to make space for local variables
  - Instead it just assumes that the memory in the 128 bytes below `%rsp` can be used by the function to store local variables
- The 128 byt region beneath `%rsp` is called the red zone
- Red zones allow a function to avoid the overhead incurred by decrementing `%rsp` on a function entry and incrementing `%rsp` on function exit

**Callee-saved vs. Caller-saved registers**

- A calling convention distinguishes between two kinds of registers
  - Caller-saved registers can be overwritten by the callee, so, if the caller wants to preserve their value, the caller must push the register values on the stack before invoking the callee
  - Callee-saved registers are assumed by the caller to not be modified by the callee, so the callee must push the register values on the stack before updating these registers
- Prevents unnecessary saving and restoring of registers
  - If the caller doesn't use a caller-saved register, the caller doesn't have to save it before invoking another function
- Ex: `%rbp` is a callee-saved register. That's why it needs to push values onto the stack and them restore them before exiting.
- The first six caller-saved registers are the same ones used to pass the first six arguments to a function
  - Callee needs to be free to mutate these during the course of computation

**Compilation lifecycle: gcc or clang**

- Compilation is a multi-step process
  - The compiler converts source code to assembly
  - The assembler converts assembly to object files
  - The linker combines object files into an executable
- A "compiler" is actually a compiler driver that orchestrates communication between these three

**Assembly Files**

- Contains human readable machine instructions
- Labels represent jump targets
- Directives convey helpful information to the assembler
- `g++ -s file.cc` tells the compiler to stop after compiling a file with the generated assembly going into `file.s`

**Object files**

- Compiler consumes a source file and generates a human readable assembly file
- But some parts are missing:
  - The assembly file doesn't associate locally-defined code or static data with memory addresses
  - The assembly file also doesn't know the addresses for externally-defined symbols
- The assembler consumes and assembly file and generates an object file
  - An object file is a binary file, not a human-readable text file
  - An object file contains binary-level representations of machine instructions and static data like strings and numbers
  - An object file also includes a symbol table and debugging information
- `g++ -c file.cc -o file.o` to generate an assembly file and then generate an object file placed in `file.o`
  - `objdump -d -C -t sum.o` to read the object file with names demangled and the symbol table

**Linking**

- Compiler consumes a source code and generates human readable assembly
  - The assembly file is missing address values of code and external references
- Assembler generates a binary-formatted object file that contains machine instructions and their relative offsets
  - Contains machine instructions, a table of global symbols, and the external symbols the object wants to import from other objects
- Linker combines object files to produce a final executable file
  - Creates a new object file that merges all of the code and data from individual objects
  - Linker patches unresolved symbol references, using the symbol table to patch missing references

**Dynamic Linking**

- Linking above shows static linking (at compile time)
  - The final executable there contains all the code needed to run the program
- With dynamic linking, we bring in a new object file while a program is executing
- `dlopen` can be used to properly require an external file at runtime
  - Maps an object file into memory as readable and executable
  - Parses the symbol table of the object file to find the locations of exported symbols
  - Allows the process to query the table and get pointers to symbols
