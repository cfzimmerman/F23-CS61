**System calls**

- A system call asks the OS to perform an action on behalf of the process issuing the call. Required due to process isolation concerns.
- The system call looks similar to a function call:
  - Process saves caller-saved registers
  - Process hands arguments to the OS via registers and invokes the `syscall` instruction
  - OS hands a return value back to the process
- Difference:
  - Unlike a normal function, the caller and callee's code live in different protection domains
  - OS has full control over all hardware and resources on a machine
  - A user mode process can only access its own registers and memory

**CPU modes**

- In privileged mode, the CPU can execute any type of instruction included privileged instructions that manipulate the CPU
- In unprivileged mode, the CPU cannot perform privileged instructions:
  - User level processes can run in unprivileged mode
  - The kernel runs in privileged mode
  - A system call flips the CPU mode to privileged before the kernel code begins execution
  - When the kernel does a context switch back to user level code, the CPU mode flips to unprivileged

**Breakdown of a system call**

- Invoking the kernel's syscall handler
- Completing the context switch
- Executing the kernel code
- Returning to user mode

**Invoking the kernel's system call handler**

- The `syscall` instruction does several things:
  - Saves the address of the instruction _after_ `syscall` in `%rcx`
  - Sets `%rip` to the value stored in the model specific register `%IA32_LSTAR`
    - Model specific registers are used to configure hardware behavior; they can be accessed via privileged instructions `rdmsr` and `wrmsr`
- `syscall` stores the old `%rflags` value in `%r11`
- `syscall` then clears the bits in `%rflags` that are set to 1 in the `%IA32_FMASK` MSR
  - Prevents hardware interrupts (this is more nuanced in a full OS)
- The CPU's privilege level is set to 0
  - Stored in the `CS` register
  - If 0, Kernel privlege, highest level
    - Ring 0
  - If 3, User privilege, lowest level
    - Ring 3

**Completing the context switch**

- Privilege bit is in Ring 0, interrupts are turned off, and the first instruction of the kernel's syscall handler is about to execute
- The kernel resides in the address space of every process
- Each address space has:
  - A series of unique memory regions that belong to a specific user level process
  - A series of kernel memory regions that are mapped into each user-level process
- Note, the memory lo ations visible to assembly instructions are virtual addresses, which are an abstraction over physical memory
  - The Memory Mapping Unit converts virtual addresses to physical addresses
- The physical memory that a CPU can access is determined by the CPU's current privilege mode
  - If privileged mode, any memory is accessible
  - If unprivileged mode, the CPU can only access the physical RAM belonging to the currently running user mode process
- Only when user mode code invokes a syscall and flip the privilege mode does the OS have access to the full scope of memory
- Invokes the kernel's C++ function `syscall` with the compiler saving callee-saved registers as needed
