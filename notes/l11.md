**Virtual Memory**

- Don't let code access physical memory directly
- CPU instructions manipulate virtual addresses, which are much more constrained than physical memory
- The kernel defines the mapping between virtual addresses and physical memory
- The CPU's MMU hardware enforces the kernel-established mapping (manages the translation between virtual and physical memory)
- Physical memory addresses are what the CPU actuall sends to DRAM hardware
- Each CPU can potentially be using a different virtual to physical mapping

**Memory mapping via pages**

- x86-64 CPUs (and others) map memory at a page size granularity
- Given a virtual page, the page table maps that virtual page to some equally sized physical page (or none if the virtual page doesn't exist)
  - Any virtual page can map to any physical page
- A computer has way less ram than virtual addresses can handle
- A page table contains access permissions

  - Is the virtual page actually present in physical RAM?
  - Is the page's data writable?
  - Is the page's data execute disabled?
  - Is the page accessible to user privileged code?

**Detailed address translation**

- The virtual address is what CPU instructions see
- MMU takes the virtual address and:
  - Extracts v bits from the virtual page number
  - Uses the page table to convert the virtual page number to a p bit physical page number
  - Sends the physical address of size `p + o` bits to RAM
- `%cr3`: control register 3, holds the physical address of a physical address (PML4, page map level four)
- Page table parsing from PML4E -> PDPTE -> PDE -> PTE uses _physical addresses_

**Why so many levels?**

- Virtual address spaces are sparse
  - So we only need to materialize physical mappings for pages that are allocated
  - A single PML4E covers 512 GB of RAM
    - If no addresses from a PML4E table are in use, the address can just be 0
- Note: Hardware itself walks the page table

**Paging: good and bad**

- Good: a virtual address space can be bigger or smaller than physical memory
- Bad: a single virtual memory access now requires five physical memory accesses
- Requires five physical memory accesses to dereference a virtual address

**Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs)**

- Make multilevel address traversal tolerable
- Idea: Cache some PTEs (virtual page to physical page) in a small hardware buffer
- If a virtual address has an entry in TLB, the CPU doesn't need to go to physical memory to fetch a PTE
- If a virtual address misses the TLB, the CPU must walk the page table to fetch a PTE
- TLBs are effective because programs exhibit locality
  - Temporal locality: when a process accesses virtual address `x`, it will likely access `x` again in the near future
- Spatial locality: when a process accesses something at memory location `x`, the process will likely access other memory locations close to `x`
  - Ex: reading elements from an array on the heap

**Lifecycle of a memory reference on x86**

- See picture in lecture slides
- Intel decides how big page tables are
