## Collaborators

Before Prof. Mickens made his post on Generative AI, I used ChatGPT a lot for basic C++ questions
and standards for idiomatic C++ design. Nothing I considered to violate the collaboration policy.
After reading the Ed post, I stopped completely.

Edit: September 28, 2023. The note above is only relevant for the first section. No collaborators,
human or not, after that.
